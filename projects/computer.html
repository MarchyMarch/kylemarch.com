				<h1>The Installation Starts</h1>
				<p>I started off the installation by adding the SSD to the motherboard.  It was an easy place for me to start because I have had experience with swapping out storage drives doing computer support at my university.  I had some friends who said that they would help me but were busy when I began assembly, so needless to say, I was a little nervous doing this on my own.</p>

				<h1>Seated the CPU</h1>
				<p>So now for the scary part... at least I thought.  My roommate said that seating the CPU is the scariest part but thankfully my motherboard had a tool to help in properly seating the CPU.  I clamped it in and it felt amazing, so of course I took some candid shots.  Now I was ready to go.</p>

			<div class="more-parts-description">
				<h1>Adding More Parts</h1>
				<p>I started to add additional parts.  I added in the RAM, which looks really nice with the motherboard.  I also mounted and plugged in the GPU and case fan.  My computer was starting to look like a real computer.</p>

		<!-- Fully Assembled -->

			<div class="fully-assembled-description">
				<h1>Fully Assembled</h1>
				<p>After figuring out where to plug everything in, I added in the liquid cooling.  So now everything was fully put together and ready for the test drive.  I got it hooked up to a monitor and flipped on the power supply and it was looking good, but as all programmers know, nothing works on the first try.  I pressed the power button and nothing.  I checked to see if the power button was going to the correct port, it was.  To make a long story short, I tested every component of my computer and after 6 hours of testing I thought it had to be the motherboard. I began to take everything apart and noticed that I had plugged the wrong power cable into the CPU power slot...</p>

			<div class="alive-description">
				<h1>IT'S ALIVE!!!</h1>
				<p>So needless to say, I found the problem.  I had confused two of the power cables, both have the same plug ins but different pin sets.  After that I plugged in the correct cable and pressed the power button and everything started to light up and whirring.  I was pumped.  Even though it was late and I had been troubleshooting for several hours I was way too excited to quit.</p>

				<p>Fans: Corsair ML120 Pro LED 120mm (x2)<br> Western Digital Black Series 2TB Hard Drive <br> One of the nice things about making your own computer is being able to switch and upgrade parts easily.  I switched the stock fans on the radiator to quieter fans and added in more storage space.</p>
